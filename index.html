                    I am Mariam, a data analyst who thrives in capturing the essence of your data to deliver legible dashboards so you can make the best decisions for your company.
                    My academic background in psychology gives me the tools to understand customer behaviours and the psychosocial factors that drive them.
                    I advocate for closing the gender data gap to improve granularity in decision-making, and thus contribute to understanding the world with more precision.

                <p class="overview">
                    Though results vary from one student to another, understanding their individual conditions leads to a better understanding of the outcome. 
                    And why certain groups are consistently one step ahead whereas others often seem to fall behind.

                <p class="overview">
                    Comparing the geographical distribution of global deaths outlines loci of political instability. The first victims often remain civilians who are subjected to displacement, famine and lack of access to first resources. The humanitarian crises that ensue weaken countries in the long run as well as impacting thousands of individual lives.
